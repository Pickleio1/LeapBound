â€‹"Oh wow, another environmental storytelling 2D retro roguelike, what a surprise!" is probably what you said after clicking on this game, but rest assured, it's exactly all that. Live, die, cry, repeat. It's frustrating but decently addicting. 

Play the game however which way you want: 

-Safe
-Try out every power-up
-Find every easter egg 
-Even try to speed run!

The game is still in a demo state and will HOPEFULLY be more fledged out in the upcoming future.
(LeapBound is a game that's been developed by university students for a project)
